                    I'm Jewels, a physics/engineering student who has around 4 years of experience in coding!
                    I live on the U.S East Coast and go to a magnet high school for physical sciences.
                    Since I was 10, I've been coding in Python, C#, and the web development languages.
                    I've also dabbled in C and C++.

                    <h3>Security</h3>
                    <p>
                        Security isn't just a feature-it's a fundamental requirement in a world increasingly reliant on technology.
                        Every solution I develop is built with safeguards at it's core, protecting both users and their data from hackers.

                    <h3>Efficiency</h3>
                    <p>
                        Efficiency is more than speed; it's about delivering results in the smartest way possible.
                        Whether it's through creating optimized code, minimizing resource usage, or designing intuitive UIs, 
                        I always aim to make the most of every line.

                    <h3>Scalability</h3>
                    <p>
                        Scalability is cruical in a time when demand grows unpredicably.
                        My work is designed to evolve alongside it's users needs, no matter how many it needs to support.

                    <h3>Innovation</h3>
                    <p>
                        Innovation is the driving force behind change.
                        I believe in challenging conventions and pushing boundaries to provide products that aren't just new-but unique.

                    <h3 class="blue">Decentralization</h3>
                    <p>
                        Decentralization represents a revolution in the way we think about the web.
                        By removing our reliance on centralized entities, 
                        decentralization allows users to take control of their data, privacy, and interactions online.

                    <h3 class="blue">Freedom</h3>
                    <p>
                        Freedom in software development is about more than functionality; 
                        it's about allowing users to share and modify tools without restrictions.
                        I firmly support the principals of free software, where collaboratiob and accessibility drive innovation and conmunity growth.

                <h2 class="blue" style="margin-top: 4%;">What I Do</h2>
                <p>Most of my work falls into 2 categories: creating tools, frameworks, and networks, and contributing to open-source projects.</p>
                <h3>Tools</h3>
                <p>
                    I've created a number of tools to help a variety of users, from developers to students to everyday people.
                    My tools are designed to be user-friendly, secure, and efficient, and are always open-source. 
                    Some of my most popular tools include Tourmaline, a directory enumeration tool for white-hat hackers,
                    or Axinite, a module for simulating orbital motion in Python.
                </p>
                <h3>Frameworks</h3>
                <p>
                    Sometimes, when I'm thinking up a new project, I realize that it could be useful to take it a step higher.
                    That's where frameworks come in. Frameworks allow developers to easily build on top of my work, 
                    creating their own tools and solutions with minimal effort. 
                </p>
                <h3>Networks</h3>
                <p>
                    Networks are the backbone of the modern web, and I'm always looking for ways to improve them.
                    Whether it's by creating new protocols, optimizing existing ones, or building decentralized networks, 
                    I'm dedicated to making the web faster, more secure, and more accessible for everyone.
                    Currently, I'm working on a new conceptual network called <a href="https://github.com/jewels86/Laserblue">Laserblue</a>
                    that aims to revolutionize the way satellites communicate.
                </p>
                <h3>Other Projects</h3>
                <p>
                    As a small developer myself, I understand the struggle of working on a project alone.
                    That's why I contribute to various open-source projects, helping to improve the tools and frameworks that others rely on.
                    Some of my favorite projects include <a href="https://github.com/Georgecane/opentune">OpenTune</a>, a free and open-source DAW,
                    <a href="https://github.com/tagoWorks/ascendara">Ascendara</a>, a easy-to-use game library/download manager, and
                    <a href="https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm">Wave Terminal</a>, a terminal emulator that prioritizes speed and productivity.
                    All of these projects are lead by amazing developers, and I encourage you to check them out!
