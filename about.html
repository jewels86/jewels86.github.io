                    I'm Jewels, a physics/engineering student who has around 4 years of experience in coding!
                    I live on the U.S East Coast and go to a magnet high school for science and engineering.
                    Since I was 10, I've been coding in both Python, and later, C# and the web technologies. 
                    I've also dabbled in C and C++. 
                    I'm passionate about build a modern, decentralized web that's secure, powerful, and open-source.

                        Decentralization is the future of the web.
                        I'm committed to building a decentralized web free from censorship, surveillance, and control.

                    <p>
                        “"Free software" means software that respects users' freedom and community. 
                        Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software. 
                        Thus, "free software" is a matter of liberty, not price.”
