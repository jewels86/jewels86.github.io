                    I'm Jewels, a physics/engineering student who has around 4 years of experience in coding!
                    I live on the U.S East Coast and go to a magnet high school for science and engineering.
                    Since I was 10, I've been coding in both Python, and later, C# and the web technologies. 
                    I've also dabbled in C and C++. 
                    I'm passionate about build a modern, decentralized web that's secure, powerful, and open-source.

                    <h3>Security</h3>
                    <p>
                        Security isn't just a feature-it's a fundamental requirement in a world increasingly reliant on technology.
                        Every solution I develop is built with safeguards at it's core, protecting both users and their data from hackers.

                    <h3>Efficiency</h3>
                    <p>
                        Efficiency is more than speed; it's abour delivering results in the smartest way possible.
                        Whether it's through creating optimized code, minimizing resource usage, or designing intuitive workflows, 
                        I always aim to make the most of every line.

                    <h3>Scalability</h3>
                    <p>
                        Scalability is cruical in a time when demand grows unpredicably.
                        My work is designed to evolve alongside it's users needs, no matter how many it needs to support.

                    <h3>Innovation</h3>
                    <p>
                        Innovation is the driving force behind change.
                        I believe in challenging conventions and pushing boundaries to provide products that aren't just new-but one-of-a-kind.

                    <p>
                        Decentralization represents a revolution in the way we think about the web.
                        By removing our reliance on centralized entities, 
                        decentralization allows users to take control of their data, privacy, and interactions online.

                    <h3 class="blue">Freedom</h3>
                    <p>
                        Freedom in software development is about mire than functionality; 
                        it's about allowing users to share and modify tools without restrictions.
                        I firmly support the principals of free software, where collaboratiob and accessibility drive innovation and conmunity growth.
